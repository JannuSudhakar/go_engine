C[AlphaGo likes Black's next local move at A, and seems to avoid this with White in most cases, as we will see in this game. More than 300 years ago, Honinbo Dosaku, who was one of the greatest players in Go history, liked to press at A, but in modern Go it had become less popular. Maybe we reasoned that Dosaku was so strong that he could win even if Black A wasn't a good move, but in any case, after AG the human asessment has changed to give Black A a high value. ]

C[Mirror Go is a term used when White plays moves that are diagonally opposite to the previous Black moves to create a position with rotational symmetry, so it does not quite describe what is happening on the upper side in this game. That said, the left and right sides do seem to mirror each other in this position. Black has the tempo to play an important move on the upper side, so it is clear that Black has an advantage, but the question is, will it be enough to pay komi? I would suggest A for Black's next move. ]
;B[gc]LB[id:A][db:B][hc:C]
C[As mentioned at move 28, I would have played at A with this move. I would reason that with the side open at B, Black does not need to get so close because White will have trouble making enough space for eyes in any case. That being my original reaction to Black 29, I have tried to learn from this move, and indeed it is not easy to make a strong argument to say that this is bad for Black. I stubbornly resist changing too much, but maybe I could go as far as to play at C. ]
(;W[hd]
C[A shoulder hit by AG. This is a very active move, which is a suprise when White is one move behind in the local fight. If White had played away with this move, say the extension-pincer on the lower side, Black would have attacked strongly in the upper left (see var). ]

C[Already this fight on the upper side is exciting, with three Black and three White groups. This is a dangerous fight for White, and relatively safe for Black because of the potential to connect at A or B. ]

C[The combination of White A with this invasion is not intuitive, but in this case it is an effective way for White to cut Black off. ]
(;B[kd]
C[Black simply curls, instead of the more aggressive hane (see var). Now there will be four groups each, jostling shoulders on the upper side, and it looks crowded. ]
;W[le];B[jf];W[lg];B[ke];W[mc];B[jh]
C[Maybe this is a good time to take a look at how all these groups are faring. A is alive of course, and B is dead. C is winning the semeai with B even if White covers on the second line. Black must be careful of D because they are the stones that cut B off and White will have options to chase them around a bit. E is weak, but White should be able to handle it by leaning on D. Black F is not settled, but will be ok since it can always connect to the left on the second line. White G has a cutting point but also can connect to the right on the second line, so it's ok. Black H is in danger, and White I is alive. So what does that all add up to? Black has more territory with a big area in the upper left, but the weak group at H balances that to make the outcome undecided. ]

C[Black does not want to mess with the White stone (see var), so jumping at 73 connects on the side while preventing a cut on the sixth line, two birds with one stone. ]

C[Is this really a ko? See the var.];B[bg];W[qg];B[hn];W[qk]
C[There were two reasons for why it was ok for White to allow the ko. One is that White had plenty of ko threats, and the second is that White A settles the ko, and is a big move that White could have played anyway (probably a bit later in the game), so White is not really losing a whole move when it settles the ko. ]
